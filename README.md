# TrueMeetmeViewers
 A Java project with a simple JavaFX UI that details how many people are in a specified Meetme livestream. This number is hidden by default on both Meetme.com and the smartphones apps.


## Note
This project is not in a stable release state and is currently in development. Therefore, HTTP Toolkit is required to run (https://httptoolkit.tech/). This tool helps anaylize Meetme's (meetme.com) REST API. The API has no available documentation.
